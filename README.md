# Optimising Software Delivery using Value Streams

It can be hard to understand why software takes so long to build and deliver. This presentation introduces
value stream mapping is a technique that can be used to represent the value stream, and to highlight the
waste (that is, non-value adding activities in the stream). We talk about various problems that the value
stream can highlight, as well as suggested strategies for improvement.
